//! Comprehensive benchmarks for linear system solvers
//!
//! This benchmark suite covers direct and iterative solvers for various
//! matrix types and system configurations, including specialized solvers
//! for structured matrices and advanced iterative methods.
//!
//! NOTE: This benchmark is currently disabled due to API incompatibilities.
//! Many of the solver functions used here are not yet implemented or have
//! different signatures than expected.
