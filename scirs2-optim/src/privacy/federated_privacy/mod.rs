//! Federated Privacy Algorithms
//!
//! This module implements privacy-preserving algorithms specifically designed
//! for federated learning scenarios, including secure aggregation, client-side
//! differential privacy, privacy amplification through federation, advanced
//! threat modeling, and cross-silo federated learning with heterogeneous clients.
