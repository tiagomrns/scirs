//! Automatic differentiation support for linear algebra operations
//!
//! This module provides integration with the scirs2-autograd crate for automatic
//! differentiation of linear algebra operations.
//!
//! ## Current Status
//!
//! The autograd module is currently in a transitional state. The scirs2-autograd
//! crate is actively being developed, and many linear algebra-specific operations
//! are not yet available. Based on feedback from the scirs2-autograd maintainers,
//! the following features are planned but not yet implemented:
//!
//! ### Missing Operations
//!
//! 1. **Built-in matrix operations**:
//!    - `eye(n, ctx)` - Identity matrix creation
//!    - `diag(vector, ctx)` - Diagonal matrix from vector
//!    - `trace(matrix)` - Matrix trace
//!
//! 2. **Decompositions with gradients**:
//!    - LU decomposition
//!    - QR decomposition
//!    - SVD decomposition
//!    - Eigendecomposition
//!
//! 3. **Complex number support**: Currently limited to real floating-point types
//!
//! 4. **Specialized matrix types**: Support for symmetric, hermitian, and triangular
//!    matrices with optimized operations
//!
//! ## Using Autograd with Linear Algebra
//!
//! Until these operations are available in scirs2-autograd, users can:
//!
//! 1. Use basic operations (matmul, transpose, element-wise ops) which are available
//! 2. Compose complex operations from primitives
//! 3. Implement custom operations using the scirs2-autograd `Op` trait
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! For current usage examples, see:
//! - `examples/autograd_basic_example.rs` - Basic differentiation
//! - `examples/autograd_linalg_example.rs` - Linear algebra operations
//!
//! ## Future Plans
//!
//! Once the requested features are implemented in scirs2-autograd, this module will
//! provide:
//!
//! - Seamless integration of all linear algebra operations with automatic differentiation
//! - Optimized gradients for matrix decompositions
//! - Support for complex-valued matrices
//! - Specialized operations for structured matrices
