# Changelog

All notable changes to scirs2-graph will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `CommunityResult` type for standardized community detection return values
- Stability attributes infrastructure for tracking API stability
- Comprehensive deprecation warnings for APIs changing in v1.0
- Performance benchmarks against NetworkX and igraph
- Large graph stress testing suite (>1M nodes)
- Memory profiling and optimization tools
- Cross-platform build verification in CI

### Changed
- Community detection algorithms now support unified return type via `CommunityResult`
- Improved documentation with algorithm complexity analysis
- Enhanced examples showing common workflows

### Deprecated
- `shortest_path` and `shortest_path_digraph` functions - use `dijkstra_path` variants for future compatibility
