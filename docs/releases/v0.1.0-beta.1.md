- **Memory Efficiency**: Optimized memory management for large datasets

## 📊 Project Statistics

- **Total Lines of Code**: 2,000,000+
- **Number of Modules**: 24 specialized crates
- **Test Coverage**: 6,500+ tests
- **Passing Tests**: All regular tests passing ✅
- **Ignored Tests**: ~600 (benchmarks and hardware-specific)

## 🔧 Recent Improvements

### GPU Test Adaptations
Fixed 12 GPU-dependent tests in the FFT module:
- CUDA initialization tests now gracefully handle missing hardware
- GPU kernel tests provide mock implementations for CPU-only systems
- Multi-GPU tests adapt to available hardware configurations
- Specialized hardware tests (FPGA/ASIC) use appropriate fallbacks

### Test Infrastructure
- Added proper test helpers for graph context management
- Improved test organization and categorization
- Clear separation between functional tests and benchmarks

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### Autograd Module
- Some gradient shape propagation limitations in complex operations (Issue #1)
- Graph context requirements for certain stability tests
- Workarounds and helper functions are provided

### Unimplemented Features
These features are planned for upcoming releases:
- Cholesky decomposition (0.2.0)
- Thin Plate Spline solver (0.2.0)
- Additional advanced linear algebra decompositions

### Performance Tests
- 404 benchmark tests are ignored by default to optimize CI build times
- Run `cargo test -- --ignored` for full benchmark suite

## 📦 Installation

Add to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
scirs2 = "0.1.0-beta.1"

# Or select specific modules:
scirs2-linalg = "0.1.0-beta.1"
scirs2-stats = "0.1.0-beta.1"
scirs2-autograd = "0.1.0-beta.1"
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```rust
use scirs2::prelude::*;
use ndarray::Array2;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Create and manipulate matrices
    let a = Array2::eye(3);
    let (u, s, vt) = scirs2::linalg::decomposition::svd(&a)?;
    
    // Statistical computations
    let normal = scirs2::stats::distributions::normal::Normal::new(0.0, 1.0)?;
    let samples = normal.random_sample(1000, None)?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

## 🔄 Migration from SciPy

SciRS2 provides SciPy-compatible APIs where reasonable, making migration straightforward:

| SciPy | SciRS2 |
|-------|--------|
| `scipy.linalg.svd()` | `scirs2::linalg::decomposition::svd()` |
| `scipy.stats.norm()` | `scirs2::stats::distributions::normal::Normal` |
| `scipy.optimize.minimize()` | `scirs2::optimize::minimize()` |
| `scipy.fft.fft()` | `scirs2::fft::fft()` |
