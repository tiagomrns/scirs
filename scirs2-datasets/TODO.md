# scirs2-datasets TODO

This module provides comprehensive dataset loading utilities similar to scikit-learn's datasets module and SciPy's datasets module.

## Production Status - 0.1.0-beta.1

This is the final alpha release before 1.0.0. All core functionality is implemented and tested.

### ✅ Production-Ready Features

**Core Infrastructure:**
- ✅ Module structure and error handling
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (117+ tests)  
- ✅ Zero-warning builds with full clippy compliance
- ✅ Documentation for all public APIs

**Dataset Loading:**
- ✅ Toy datasets (iris, boston, digits, wine, breast_cancer, diabetes)
- ✅ CSV, JSON, ARFF, and LIBSVM format support
- ✅ Memory-efficient loading with preprocessing
- ✅ Robust caching system with SHA256 verification
- ✅ Registry system for dataset metadata

**Data Generation:**
- ✅ Classification datasets (linear and non-linear)
- ✅ Regression datasets with configurable noise
- ✅ Clustering datasets (blobs, hierarchical)
- ✅ Non-linear patterns (spirals, moons, swiss roll, circles)
- ✅ Time series generators with various noise models
- ✅ Data corruption utilities (missing data, outliers)

**Dataset Utilities:**
- ✅ Cross-validation (k-fold, stratified k-fold, time series)
- ✅ Train/test splitting with stratification
- ✅ Sampling utilities (random, stratified, bootstrap, importance)
- ✅ Data balancing (over/under-sampling, SMOTE)
- ✅ Feature engineering (polynomial features, binning, statistics)
- ✅ Scaling and normalization (min-max, robust, standard)

**Performance & Reliability:**
- ✅ Platform-specific caching
- ✅ Batch operations for efficiency
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling
- ✅ Memory-efficient implementations
