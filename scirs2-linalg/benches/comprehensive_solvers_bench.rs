//! Comprehensive benchmarks for linear system solvers
//!
//! This benchmark suite covers direct and iterative solvers for various
//! matrix types and system configurations, including specialized solvers
//! for structured matrices and advanced iterative methods.
//!
//! NOTE: This benchmark is currently disabled due to API incompatibilities.
//! Many of the solver functions used here are not yet implemented or have
//! different signatures than expected.

    // println!("The benchmark uses solver functions that are not yet implemented.");
    // println!("This will be re-enabled once the solver API is stabilized.");
