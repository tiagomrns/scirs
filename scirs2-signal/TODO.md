# scirs2-signal TODO

This module provides signal processing functionality similar to SciPy's signal module.

## ðŸš¨ URGENT: SIMD DISABLING PROJECT (Current Priority)

**Status**: Active compilation issue resolution
**Target**: Fully functional scirs2-signal module with SIMD disabled  
**Estimated Time**: 5-7 hours
**Current Errors**: 1000+ due to missing SIMD implementations

### IMMEDIATE TASKS (Current Session)
- [x] **Phase 0**: Project documentation setup (TODO.md, PROGRESS.md, README.md)
- [ ] **Phase 1**: Error categorization and analysis (30 mins)
- [ ] **Phase 2**: Investigate scalar implementation fallbacks (45 mins)  
- [ ] **Phase 3**: Create automated fix scripts (1-1.5 hours)
- [ ] **Phase 4**: Implement missing scalar functions (2-3 hours)
- [ ] **Phase 5**: Fix non-SIMD issues (rand::chacha, ndarray::s) (1 hour)
- [ ] **Phase 6**: Full compilation testing (30 mins)
- [ ] **Phase 7**: Documentation and handover prep (45 mins)

### IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY
- **Disable SIMD optimizations** via scalar fallbacks
- **Preserve API surface** for future SIMD re-enabling
- **Focus on correctness** over performance for now
- **Systematic pattern-based** batch fixing approach
