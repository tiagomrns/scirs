//! Morphological operations on n-dimensional arrays
//!
//! This module provides functions for performing morphological operations on n-dimensional
//! arrays, such as erosion, dilation, opening, closing, gradient, tophat and more.
//!
//! Morphological operations are nonlinear operations that process images based on shapes.
//! They can be used for many purposes: removing noise, extracting features, detecting edges, etc.
//!
//! # Usage Recommendations
//!
//! For best results, use the following guidelines:
//!
//! 1. For 1D and 2D arrays, use the specific implementations:
//!    - For 1D arrays, the generic `binary_*` functions will automatically use optimized 1D implementations
//!    - For 2D arrays, prefer the functions in the `simple_morph` module, like `binary_erosion_2d` and `grey_dilation_2d`
//!
//! 2. For n-dimensional arrays of arbitrary dimension:
//!    - Use the generic functions (`binary_erosion`, `grey_dilation`, etc.), but be aware of limitations
//!    - Convert your arrays to `IxDyn` dimension type before passing to these functions
//!    - Some operations for dimensions greater than 2 are limited in functionality
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use ndarray::{Array2, array};
//! use scirs2_ndimage::morphology::simple_morph::binary_erosion_2d;
//!
//! // Create a binary image
//! let input = array![[false, true, true],
//!                    [false, true, true],
//!                    [false, false, false]];
//!
//! // Apply binary erosion
//! let result = binary_erosion_2d(&input, None, None, None, None).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(result[[1, 1]], false); // Corner pixels are eroded
//! ```
