//! Batch matrix operations optimized for neural networks
//!
//! This module provides specialized batch matrix operations that are commonly
//! used in neural network computations, such as batch matrix multiplication,
//! batch normalization operations, convolution operations, attention mechanisms,
//! and RNN/LSTM operations.
