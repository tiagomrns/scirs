# scirs2-fft Progress Report

## Completed Tasks

1. **Code Cleanup and Optimization**
   - Fixed Clippy warnings for needless range loops by replacing them with iterator methods
   - Optimized Hilbert transform implementation with better memory usage
   - Improved functional style in FFT operations using iterator methods
   - Fixed deprecated rand API calls (thread_rng → rng, gen_range → random_range)
   - Updated manual range-based max/min operations to use clamp() where appropriate

2. **Examples and Documentation**
   - Created examples for spectral analysis and visualization
   - Added comprehensive examples for Hilbert transform, fractional FFT, and non-uniform FFT
   - Ensured all public APIs are properly documented
   - Added detailed usage examples in README
   - Fixed documentation indentation and formatting

3. **FFT Module Enhancement**
   - Maintained comprehensive FFT functionality matching SciPy's capabilities
   - Optimized memory usage in FFT operations
   - Implemented functional programming patterns for clarity and performance
   - Fixed error handling to be more informative
   - Ensured all public functions have proper error types

4. **Testing**
   - All unit tests passing
   - All examples are complete and working
   - Documentation tests are passing

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Performance Issues**
   - The following functions have too many arguments and might need a builder pattern or options struct in the future:
     - `stft` in spectrogram.rs
     - `spectrogram` in spectrogram.rs
     - `waterfall_lines` in waterfall.rs
     - `stft` in lib.rs

2. **Documentation Enhancement**
   - Add more visual examples for the visualization functions
   - Create comparison benchmarks with SciPy equivalents
   - Further document performance characteristics

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Improve Fractional Fourier Transform handling of complex numbers (several tests currently ignored)
   - Implement GPU-accelerated FFT operations (long-term)
   - Add distributed FFT computation support (long-term)

## Overall Progress

The FFT module is now fully functional and optimized, meeting all the core requirements. The code follows best practices, is well-documented, and passes all tests. The main areas for future improvement are the API design for complex functions with many parameters and advanced features like GPU acceleration.
